This repository contains all the PowerShell scripts created for the Livefire VCF - Design and Automation with VVS class.  Feel free to take these scripts, modify, improve and use as you see fit.  You will need to download and install the VMware PowerShell tookits as folllows.

PowerVCF, VMware.PowerCLI and PowerValidatedSolutions

Without those toolkits, the majority of the scripts will not work.

There will be updates, additional script and custom functions added to this repository over the next couple of months, so please check back from time to time.
